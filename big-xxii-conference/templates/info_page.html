	<h3>History of the conference</h3>
	<p class="monteserrat">The council was created in 1977 when Black students from all the schools in the Big Eight Conference came together in recognition that they were suffering from similar problems at their respective institutions. The next year, the University of Missouri students formally created the Big Eight Council and Conference on Black Student Government. In 1997, the Big Eight Conference was expanded to include four Texas institutions forming the new Big XII Conference. The Big Eight Council on Black Student Government officially changed their name to the Big XII Council on Black Student Government and included the four Texas schools into the structure of the organization. Each year, an institute member of the Big XII Council on Black Student Government hosts the Annual Big XII Conference on Black Student Government.</p>
	<p class="monteserrat">The Big XII Council on Black Student Government is a regional Black Student Governing Body, which consists of the Black Student Governments from institutions in the Big XII conference. Those schools include: the University of Missouri, the University of Oklahoma, Kansas State University, the University of Colorado, Iowa State University, the University of Nebraska, Oklahoma State University, the University of Kansas, Baylor University, The University of Texas, Texas Tech University, and Texas A&M University.</p><br/>
