					Hello from The Great State of Texas!<br/><br/>
	 
					On behalf of the Planning Committee for the 40th Annual Big XII Conference on Black Student Government, we want officially invite students, staff, faculty, alumni and community members to submit a workshop or a poster proposal to present at the 40th Annual Big XII Conference on Black Student Government from February 16-18, 2017!  The conference is hosted at the University of Texas at Austin and we are excited to host some interactive, engaging and innovative workshops that will supplement what is learned at this prestigious leadership development conference.<br/><br/>
					
					This year’s theme is Making the Movement Matter.  The Big XII Conference on Black Student Government’s mission statement is: to provide strong, determined and courageous leadership and advocacy to affect our social and academic environments toward consideration of this community's collective concerns and issues where it pertains to the educational, socio-cultural, economic, and spiritual well-being of this community.<br/><br/>
					 
					Workshops should utilize the theme and the conference mission statement to organize effective learning outcomes for participants at the conference.<br/><br/>
					 
					New to the conference format, we are hosting a Poster Presentation, where students can present research that covers a variety of academic topics. We believe that undergraduate Research is an advancing field that should be highlighted. We encourage you to apply to conduct a poster presentation of any academic research you have done in any field that we will showcase during the conference. Your work will be seen by students and faculty from the University of Texas at Austin and from universities across the country!<br/><br/>
					 
					All proposals must be received by December 1st!<br/><br/>
