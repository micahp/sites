						<p>September 1, 2016</p>
						<p>Peace and Blessings:</p>
						<p>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure." On behalf of the Planning Committee for the 33rd Annual Big XII Conference on Black Student Government, we want officially invite students, staff, faculty, alumni and community members to submit a Call For Workshops to potentially present a workshop at the 33rd Annual Big XII Conference on Black Student Government from February 25-28, 2010!  The conference is hosted at the University of Texas at Austin and we are excited to host some interactive, engaging and innovative workshops that will supplement what is learned at this prestigious leadership development conference. This year's theme is Powerful Beyond Measure!</p>
						<p>The conference mission is to provide strong, determined and courageous leadership and advocacy to affect our social and academic environments toward consideration of this community's collective concerns and issues where it pertains to the educational, socio-cultural, economic and spiritual well-being of this community.  Through the workshops we will have at this conference, there is an opportunity for you to help our conference participants fully understand what it means to be Powerful Beyond Measure! This year, the Conference Committee will focus on seven key areas and we ask that all workshop proposals follow this specific subject matter: Ourstory, Inspiration, Wellness, Finances, Relationships, Our Present and Leadership. All proposals must be received by December 1st!</p>

				<h3>Key Areas</h3>
				<ol class="monteserrat padding-bottom">
					<li>Powerful Beyond Ourstory:  We believe that our-story is often misrepresented and not told the way in which is beneficial to our understanding of who we really are as people of African descent.  This set of workshops should focus on 1st Year Transition Issues, Greek Life, History of Our People, etc.</li>
					<li>Powerful Beyond Inspiration:  One of the greatest motivators in life is inspiration!  We draw from the energy of positivity, so this set of workshops should focus on Spiritual Development, Motivation, Community Service, etc.</li>
					<li>Powerful Beyond Wellness:  We never spend enough time really talking through appropriate ways to take care of ourselves around wellness issues.  This set of workshops should focus on Health Care, Sexual Health, Fitness/Diet.</li>
					<li>Powerful Beyond Finances: It is always important for us to focus our financial responsibility and opportunity. This set of workshops will focus on Scholarships/Financial Aid, Understanding Credit, Entrepreneurship, etc.</li>
					<li>Powerful Beyond Relationships: We all know that we must critically think about how we build, maintain and experience relationships with one another.  This set of workshops should focus on Leaders and Followers, Community, Dating Relationships, LGBT Issues, etc.</li>
					<li>Powerful Beyond Our Present:  Forward-thinking is what will prepare us best for the future ahead.  This set of workshops should focus on Graduation, Life Planning, Family, Graduate/Professional School, etc.</li>
					<li>Powerful Beyond Leadership:  How do we take our leadership to the next level?  This set of workshops should focus on Creative Programming, Recruiting Membership, Off-campus Opportunities, etc.</li>

			<h3>Workshop Presenter Information</h3>
			<div class="monteserrat">
				<p>FTHRW is an online only chapter of Romance Writers of America. We have over 300 members. We sponsor online workshops on a variety of topics for chapter members as well as non-chapter participants. The classes are offered for free to our members. Non-members are asked to pay a fee of $10-$25 per class, depending on the length of the course offered.</p>
				<p>Usually about 50-75 people sign up and about 15-25 of those are active (as opposed to just lurkers). We do not put a cap on the number of participants, but if a speaker requires it, we are happy to discuss this with the presenter.</p>
				<p>We ask that any lesson you post on the loop you also post as a text or pdf file in the Files section of the Yahoo FTHRW Workshops loop to assist class members with locating the lesson and catching up if they miss any.</p>
				<p>We also ask that you provide us with a short bio and blurb about the course that we will post on our website to attract participants.</p>
				<p>We advertise on various writer loops (both RWA and non-RWA), and in the Online Workshops column of Romance Writers Report (RWR). When warranted, we place an ad about our workshops in RWR.</p>
				<p>Our standard stipend is $100 for a 1-week workshop, $150 for a 2-week workshop, $200 for a 3-week workshop and $250 for a 4-week workshop, but we are willing to discuss fees with the presenter.</p>
