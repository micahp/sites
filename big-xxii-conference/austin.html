				<p class="monteserrat slim-padding">Austin is an incredible place to live, work, play and invest, and it's easy to see why. Since 2011, Austin has received more than 50 local and national rankings. And there are so many things to do here! For more information on what makes our city so unique, be sure to visit the Austin Convention and Visitors Bureau website. Located in Central Texas on the eastern edge of the American Southwest, Austin is the capital of the state of Texas, the Lone Star State. The city dates back to the 1830s, when the first Anglo-American settlers arrived in the area, then part of Mexico. In 1837, settlers founded the village of Waterloo on the banks of the Colorado River, the first permanent settlement in the area. By 1839, Waterloo would adopt the name Austin and the frontier town would become the capital of the Republic of Texas. The City is named for Stephen F. Austin, the "Father of Texas."</p>
				<h3>City Attractions - <a href="http://www.austintexas.org/visit/things-to-do/">austintexas.org</a></h3>
				<p class="monteserrat slim-padding">The secret is out. Everyone who visits Austin these days leaves with something great to say. They can't stop talking about our legendary live music, burgeoning restaurant scene and unique culture. And a list of other things that you just have to experience for yourself to truly understand what makes Austin so Austin. The rest of the country has already taken notice. And it's time you did, too. Years ago when people talked about Austin they would quickly mention the music. But that's just the beginning of what they're saying these days. Austin is also home to a wonderful ballet, world-class museums, one-of-a-kind shopping and beautiful outdoor spaces. You can just as easily spend your morning paddling the lake as you can strolling through a celebrated history museum. And it's okay if you don't have time to fit it all in, you can just come back and visit us again.</p>
